      OrbitView is thinking about rebranding a portion of it to become like a
      W3Schools but for young entrepreneurs. We believe that measuring the
      growth and progress of an entrepreneur should be standardized in a way
      that tells investors or their coworkers. This is a great business model
      and idea that aligns with our "anti-business school" model. Pair this
      learning tool with the networking on OrbitView. VIOLA! you have an
      accessible YC at any entrepreneur's hands, well not really, but
      significantly improved.

      We are not a necessarily a founder's network but rather a place for people
      who want to take their "founder" skills to the next level
      <br />
      <br />
      Target audience: Gen Z's who want to become founders (every single one of
      them wants a big pocket and money, so they are willing to pay a lot:
      ambitious people pay for education)
      <br />
      <br />
      AI benefits: with massive amounts of curriculum, you can train your LLMs
      or sell this information to developers who want to make similar tools
      <br />
      Use case: a chatbot that will be by your side as you run your startup,
      assisting you in many ways = powerful technology and tools
