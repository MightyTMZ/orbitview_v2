stick to 1 file for rendering the events

for user toggle between ultra-simple, simple, and comprehensive rendering of events,
use the "useState"

const [eventsRenderingFormat, setEventRenderingFormat] = useState("simple")

if user changes preference, act accordingly:

setEventRenderingFormat("comprehensive")
setEventRenderingFormat("ultra-simple")
setEventRenderingFormat("comprehensive")


use this variable to determine how the events get rendered (aka mapped in the DOM)

REMEMBER THAT YOU MUST STICK TO USING THE "comprehensive" ENDPOINT
IT OFFERS THE MOST INFORMATION + METADATA OF AN EVENT

MOST FIELDS WILL NOT BE RENDERED, BUT SERVE AS META DATA CRUCIAL FOR ADDITIONAL FEATURES IN THE FUTURE
